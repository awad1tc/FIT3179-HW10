                    <p>The following map visualises the reviews received by restaurants duing New York Food Week 2018.
                        We can see that there is a strong concentration of restaurants in downtown Manhattan (see the
                        focused Manhattan view for a better idea of how restaurants are positioned), with a few
                        in Staten Island and Brooklyn. Queens and The Bronx did not have any restaurants reviewed across
                        the data. Staten Island and Brooklyn have no <span class="expText">expensive</span> restaurants.
                        Overall most restuarnts are <span class="cheapText">cheap</span> or <span class="midText">mid
                            priced.</span>

                    <h2>Average Review Scores by Restaurant Type </h2>
                    <p>This visulaisation shows the average reviews scores by category for each restaurant type against
                        the overall average review score given to each restaurant taking into account all factors. It is
                        interesting to see that the majority of restaurants receive category reviews on average that are
                        worse than the overall average. For the most part price plays a factor with <span
                            class="expText">expensive</span> restaurants ranking the highest.</p>

                        more pronounced for American and Contemporary American cuisine. French restaurants have the
                        smallest variance across price range. The divergence tends to get smaller as we filter by the
                        number of reviews a restaurant has received. This indicates that better restaurants get reviewed
                        more.</p>

                    <h2>Review Score Distribution </h2>
                    <p>Looking at the distribution of average review scores by both restaurant and price range we can
                        see something interesting.
                        <span class="expText">Expensive</span> restaurants never receive poor
                        reviews, they are all
                        distributed between 4 and 5. However, there are just as many highly rated <span
                            class="midText">mid priced</span> restaurants
                        as there are <span class="expText">expensive</span> ones. <span class="cheapText">Cheaper</span>
                        restaurants have a wider variance, but still have
                        representation between 4 and 5.
